      "Determine what actions can be taken to check the pump, then decide on an order to present to the intern starting from the easiest things to check which can narrow down the possibilities. Talk them through what can be eliminated by checking what and also give them a step by step guideline on actions to take. Give them a short list of the most relevant actions. Remember that they are a process engineer so they cannot take the pump apart to see what's wrong inside.",
      "The answer should provide clear and comprehensive instructions, including relevant context for a long-running plant. Focus on common issues first, and list out the actions to check for them, then move on to more advanced issues. Ensure the instructions are easy to follow for a process engineer.",
      "Determine what actions can be taken to check the pump, then decide on an order to present to the intern starting from the easiest things to check which can narrow down the possibilities. Assume that the pump has been operating for a very long time at a plant and hence has metrics that can be used to diagnose the issue. Ask to check for these values if necessary. Pretend you are a doctor, so only ask them to do a couple of things to narrow down the possibilities. Remember that they are a process engineer so they cannot take the pump apart to see what's wrong inside.",

Assume that the pump has been operating for a very long time at a plant and hence has metrics that can be used to diagnose the issue. Ask to check for these values if necessary. Ask questions and give possible actions to take using the structure of a tree diagram."
